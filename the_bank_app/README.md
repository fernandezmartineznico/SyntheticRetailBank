## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Secrets Management**: Never commit `secrets.toml` to version control
- **Access Control**: Use least-privilege Snowflake roles
- **PII Handling**: Consider masking sensitive fields (email, phone) in exports
- **Audit Logging**: Enable Snowflake query history for compliance

### Best Practices

1. **Use separate credentials** for development vs. production
2. **Rotate passwords** regularly
3. **Enable MFA** on Snowflake accounts
4. **Restrict warehouse size** to control costs
5. **Monitor query execution** for performance and security

---

## Technical Details

### AI Agent Implementation (REST API)

The **Ask AI** tab uses Snowflake Cortex AI Agent via **REST API** instead of SQL functions. This approach is more reliable and avoids the `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE_AGENT` function error.

**Architecture**:
```
User Question
  ↓
Streamlit App (app.py)
  ↓
Agent Caller (utils/agent_caller.py)
  ↓
Snowflake REST API
  ↓
POST /api/v2/databases/{db}/schemas/{schema}/agents/{agent}:run
  ↓
AI Agent (CRM_CUSTOMER_360)
  ↓
Server-Sent Events (SSE) Stream
  ↓
Response Text Extraction
  ↓
Display to User
```

**Key Files**:
- `utils/agent_caller.py` - REST API client for agent invocation
- `app.py` (Tab 13) - UI for AI queries with fallback search

**How it works**:
1. Gets REST API token from Snowflake session
2. Calls `/api/v2/databases/.../agents/{agent}:run` endpoint
3. Handles Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming response
4. Parses event stream to extract text responses
5. Falls back to keyword search if agent fails

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Works with standard Snowflake authentication
- ✅ Handles streaming responses correctly
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging
- ✅ Compatible with test_single_agent.py approach
- ✅ No SQL function dependency

**Agent Configuration**:
```python
agent_full_name = "AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK.CRM_AGG_001.CRM_CUSTOMER_360"
timeout = 60  # seconds
```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test agent via CLI
python test_agents/test_single_agent.py CRM_CUSTOMER_360 "Show me PLATINUM customers"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** "Failed to connect to Snowflake"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify credentials in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
2. Check Snowflake account name format: `account.region.cloud` (e.g., `xy12345.eu-central-1.aws`)
3. Ensure warehouse is running
4. Test connection via Settings tab

### Data Loading Issues

**Problem:** "Error loading customer data"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify table exists: `CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_360`
2. Check user has SELECT privileges
3. Ensure database/schema are correct
4. Test query in Snowsight UI first

### AI Query Issues

**Problem:** "AI query failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Cortex AI Agent exists: `SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS.CRM_INTELLIGENCE_AGENT`
2. Ensure user has USAGE privilege on agent
3. Check semantic view is deployed: `CRMA_SV_CUSTOMER_360`
4. Fallback: Use manual search in Customer 360° tab

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** App is slow to load

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `ttl` in cache decorators (default: 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
2. Increase Snowflake warehouse size
3. Add filters before loading large datasets
4. Check network latency to Snowflake region

---

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

The app uses Streamlit's caching to minimize Snowflake queries:

```python
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600) # Cache for 1 hour
def load_customer_360():
 #... data loading logic
```

**Tune caching:**
- Increase `ttl` (time-to-live) for less frequent refreshes
- Decrease `ttl` for more real-time data
- Use manual refresh button in Settings tab to clear cache

### Query Optimization

All data loading functions use optimized SQL:

1. **Select only needed columns** (avoid `SELECT *` in production)
2. **Filter at database level** (push filters to Snowflake)
3. **Use aggregations** (GROUP BY) for summary views
4. **Leverage dynamic tables** (CRMA_AGG_DT_* tables are pre-aggregated)
